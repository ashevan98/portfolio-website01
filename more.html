                <h1>Web Development</h1>
                <div class="blogitem">
                    <p>Web development dates back to the rise of the world wide web as a means of connecting people across the globe. The idea of the World Wide Web was not embraced by everyone until the visually accessible “web browsers” paved their way in the early 1990s. Since then, web development has been in play in making things and information more accessible and digitally attractive to people. This field has been evolving constantly, from HTML and CSS to JavaScript frameworks and server-side programming. <br></p>

                <h1>HTML</h1>
                <div class="blogitem">
                    <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance. <br></p>
                </div>
                <h1>CSS</h1>
                <div class="blogitem">
                    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file. <br></p>
                </div>
                <h1>JavaScript</h1>
                <div class="blogitem">
                    <p>JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user. <br></p>
